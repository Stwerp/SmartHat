Small QAM Board for demoing QAM backscatter

BinaryModDemo.c --> Beeps and transmits random I-or-Q data (Only transmits binary data). Useful for demoing backscatter comms.
Demodulation.c --> Used to test demodulation circuit.
BERIQTransmitTesting.c --> Set I and Q strings are transmitted as IQ, QPSK/4QAM data. Known strings are then compared in matlab/java to determine BER of channel.
